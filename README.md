# Hotel_Booking_Data_Analysis
This is a end to end Data Analysis Project where I have performed data cleaning, extensive EDA, Featue engineering and Data visulaization and tried to find various hidden patterns and trends that affects high cancellation rates of Hotels. In the end some necessary suggestions are given through reports that Hotel Owner must consider to tackle the business problem and generate revenues.
